# SC1015 Mini Project

## About
This is a mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on prediction of aircraft repairability after an incident based on [Aircraft Accidents, Failures & Hijacks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/aircraft-accidents-failures-hijacks-dataset)

## Problem Definition
Throughout the years as air travel becomes more and more prevalent, so have accidents or mishaps pertaining to aircraft. The problem we aim to solve is to identify whether the aircraft is still repairable or has undergone too much damage to be repaired after an incident. We take into account the age of the aircraft, the type of incident that has occured as well as the manufacturer to determine the possibility of servicing it or cutting losses and scrapping it.

## Models Used
1) Logistic Regression Classifier

## Conclusion
About 70% of the time its able to predict if an aicraft is beyond repair while about 80% of the time its able to predict if an aicraft is repairable. If an organisation has variables such as manufacturer, aircraft age and incident cause, it may be able to preliminarily conclude if an aircraft is repairable or not through this model.

## What did we learn from this project?
* Handling and cleaning of a large dataset
* Logistic Regression from sklearn
* Collaborating using GitHub
